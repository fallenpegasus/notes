Engagement on the community's terms
  You cant force obedience
  If you try, they will ignore you
  may result in a fork, that leaves you behind
  Why help competitors?  If you dont
    they stay in the upstream
    you get left behind
    you lose latest tech
    you lose influence
    you lose credibility

  make the market grow, more users

Good Table Manners
  concept from Brian Aker and Mark Burton
  follow positive community norms
  "No Assholes" rule
  coding standards
  when have credibility, can drive improvement
    "we do it this way" is not necessariliy improvement
  social media engagement

Public Communication
  use the project's existing email lists
  IRC channels
  bug tracker
  DVCS
  forges (github.com is not the only one)

Governance Models
  all projects have one
  some as complex as openstack
  some as scary as Linux
  most as simple as one guy
    with patches from email
    or with pull requests on github
  as a project grows, governance model will grow with it
  much of the really transformative sw dev tools of open source is automating governance
  do not try to "take over" the governance of a project, or it will fork
  projects that are forbidden from forking away from a for-profit corporate
    do not have an open source governance
    will not get outside contributions
      maybe occational very simple bug fixes
