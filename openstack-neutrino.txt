most of OpenStack Neutron goes away if
  assume/require IPv6
  assume/require DHCPv6
  assume/require DNS multicast ZC auto discovery

codename Neutrino

all interfaces on all instances get local and group IPv6 address
even local and group addresses are as unique as possible
metadata service is at well known IPv6 anycast address?
do need metadata service at all?: if DHCPv6 and ZC is working
local rfc1918 ipv4 is discouraged
global ipv4 routable addresses, costs

if your OS cant do v6, v6 dhcp, then its not supported
