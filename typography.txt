Five Rules of Typography

quality is largely how the body text looks
point size on paper 12 to 12 point
on web, 15-25 px
line spacing should be 120% to 145% of point size
  in Microsoft Word, use the "exact" line spacing option
  in CSS, use line-height
  a single line, 100%, is too tight
  a line and a half, 150%, is too loose
line length should average 45-90 characters per line
or 2 to 3 lowercase alphabets
in print, that means margins greater than the traditional 1 inch
on web, do not allow text to flow to the edges
but on e-readers and mobile, don't waste screen space on margins

font choice
  dont use system fonts
  if you do use system fonts
     dont use Times New Romane
     dont use Arial
  never ever use "goofy fonts"
  never use monospaced fonts
     except for computer source code

use curly quotes, not straight quotes
put only one space after a sentence
never use underline

center text sparingly
use bold and italic as little as possible
ALL CAPS for less than one line of text, never for multiple lines or an entire paragraph or more
always have kerning on

first line of paragraph
  use indent of 1 to 4 times the print size
  OR
  use 4-10 points of space between paragraphs
  but never both

if you use justified text, turn on hypenation
do not confuse hyphens and dashs
do not use multiple hyphens as ersatz dashs
use ampersands sparingly
one exclamation mark every 3 pages is plenty
do not use alphabetic approximations of trademark and copyright symbols
put a nonbreaking space after paragraph marks and after section marks
make sure apostrophies point downward
make sure that foot marks and inch marks are straight, not curly
