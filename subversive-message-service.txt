ideas for a subversion message service

issues
  avoid flood of bogus users
  avoid flood of spam messages
link account setup to blockchain?
  provides payment
  distribution of keys
  is there a well known or useful API to the blockchain other than running a local instance?

datatypes
  pii
    tel
    terminal id
    email address
    social media url
  uid
  kid k kpub kpri
  t
  guid
  msg
  geo

each user computes for each contact
  hash(my id + their id)
problem: space is too small

create user
  user creates keypair
  user creates uid
  user publishes uid, pub key, and proof

broadcast
  gen msg from user input
  gen onetime symkey otk
  encrypt msg with otk
  encrypt otk with privkey
  write to public datapool
    uid + p(otk) + e(msg)

unicast
  gen msg from user input
  gen onetime symkey otk
  write to datapool
    t uid + f uid + e(otk) + e(msg)

datapool auto deletes message when it is old
