paranoid-email

how hard can it be?

open source backend
federation, of course

protocols:
  - imap
  - jmap
  - nylas
  - smtp
  - google

each user has an account pubkey

get message from not-paranoid peer
  get envelope, lookup user
  create message key
  save to messagecatalog the msgid, encrypted message key, userid
  receive msg over the wire, encrypt it with msg key 
  forget message key
  store encrypted message, with handle msgid

user wants message
  get list of messages, with date filter
  delete msg by id, with proof
  retrieve msg by id, still encrypted

all messages age off

can my protocol be built on top of
  nylas
  jmap

AWS notes
  message catalog in SQS
  message body in S3
  usercatalog in SQS
