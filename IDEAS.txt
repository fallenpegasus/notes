QUESTION what is the Garmen RINO OTA protocol?
  Radio Integrated Navigation Outdoors

IDEA Garmen RINO to APRS bridge
listen for RINO data
retransmit as APRS data
uses RINO radio name as /slashid
plus channel id to letter

IDEA GMRS to SIP bridge
listens to all GMRS/FRS channels
SIP channel for each
decodes Garmen RINO data
what should go in the SIP medadata?

IDEA
datawand
uses unlicensed ISTM bands
wifi frames ethernet
ipv6 multicast or a wicast ethertype
node address is a public key
opportunistic store and forward, slow flood
each keeps a list of macs and node addresses seen, directly and indirectly
snoops traffic to keep updated on that list
possible to bridge to the internet
  keep internet online list of node ids
  internet hosts can subscribe to a node id
    both xmit and receive
message to a node are encrypted
  by a random key that is encrypted with the destination node's public key
in a single packet, short text message, UTF8 encoded
every packet has
  timestamp
  unique id
    maybe source node plus local unique
  used for
    timeout
    for loop and dup detection
long message format
  break into packets
  each packet has
    long message id
    long message size
    offset and length
    data
  expect out of order
  attempt partial decode
